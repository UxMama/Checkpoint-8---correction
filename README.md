# Checkpoint-8---correction

Hello, I have completed the User Flow checkpoint although I believe I slightly misunderstood the "options to sign up for facebook, twitter or email". In my original submission, I selected one of those platforms (Gmail sign up) and created a User Flow unique to that platform.  I'm waiting for grading but I was able to get clarification n Slack and wanted to submit another User Flow with the correct understanding of the assignment.

Here is the link to my new User Flow:
